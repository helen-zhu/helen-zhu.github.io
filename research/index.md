# Research


My Ph.D. research focuses on characterizing m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in primary prostate cancer using and developing techniques in computational biology.

**Prostate cancer** is the second most common malignancy in men. Primary prostate cancer can be stratified using clinical variables into low, intermediate and high risk groups which have significantly different prognosis. Molecular characterization of tumours can enrich our understanding of underlying tumour biology but importantly, translate to better clinical decision making.

**N<sup>6</sup>-Methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A)** is the most common RNA modification on mRNA and lncRNA transcripts. Dynamic and reversible, it plays an essential role in the regulation of RNA processing, from splicing to translation to degradation. Using a technique called meRIP-seq, researchers are able to map out specific methylation sites on RNA transcripts.
