# Welcome, Friend

You have found my personal webpage!

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in computational genomics at the University of Toronto, advised by [Dr. Housheng (Hansen) He](https://www.hansenhelab.org/). My thesis was focused on cancer epitranscriptomics, specifically how the RNA modification m<sup>6</sup>A manifests in primary prostate cancer. I also completed my M.Sc. in computational biology working on understanding noncoding mutations in the cancer genome.

During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to try out some cool things! I completed an internship at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) where I learned a lot about building the AI pipeline for therapeutic development. I am honoured to have also been a post-graduate affiliate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). In my spare time, I was a member of the [Medical Biophysics Graduate Student Association](https://www.mbpgsa.ca/) where we worked to build a graduate student community with many fun and diverse initiatives.

Prior to that, I spent the four years of my undergraduate degree in the [Bachelor of Health Sciences program](https://bhsc.mcmaster.ca/) at McMaster University where my professors used [problem-based learning](https://mdprogram.mcmaster.ca/md-program/overview/pbl---problem-based-learning) to teach us how to work in groups, a skill I deeply value up to this day. During that time, I also studied mathematics and worked in [Dr. Cecile Fradin's](https://physics.mcmaster.ca/~biophys/molbiophys/index.html) biophysics research laboratory studying how apoptotic proteins interact with the mitochondrial membrane. As a result, I picture all proteins as tiny [molecular machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-uuk4Pr2i8).

If you want to learn more about me, check out my Github, Google Scholar, Twitter or LinkedIn - links below! A few facts that you won't find on my C.V. are that I love biking and exploring the city, particularly the museums, and finding new restaurants!

I love to caffeinate and meet new people. Please get in touch if you would like to chat!
