# Welcome, Friend

{% capture text %}
I am currently a computational biology Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Medical Biophysics](https://medbio.utoronto.ca/medical-biophysics) at the University of Toronto, advised by [Dr. Housheng (Hansen) He](https://www.hansenhelab.org/). I am supported by a CIHR Doctoral Fellowship. I am also a post-graduate affiliate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) where I attend many interesting talks. I also sit on the [MBP Graduate Student Association](https://www.mbpgsa.ca/) where we try to make graduate school more fun than it already is one cool event at a time.

I completed my MSc in computational biology in Dr. Juri Reimand's lab working on noncoding driver mutations in the cancer genome. I spent the four years of my undergraduate degree in the [Bachelor of Health Sciences program](https://bhsc.mcmaster.ca/) at McMaster University where my professors used [problem-based learning](https://mdprogram.mcmaster.ca/md-program/overview/pbl---problem-based-learning) to teach us how to work in groups, a skill I deeply value up to this day. During that time, I also studied mathematics and worked in [Dr. Cecile Fradin's](https://physics.mcmaster.ca/~biophys/molbiophys/index.html) biophysics research laboratory studying how apoptotic proteins interact with the mitochondrial membrane. As a result, I picture all proteins as tiny [molecular machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-uuk4Pr2i8).

If you want to learn more about me, check out my Github, Google Scholar, Twitter or LinkedIn - links below! A few facts that you won't find on my C.V. are that I love biking and exploring the city, particularly the museums, and finding new restaurants!

Like many graduate students, I love to caffeinate and meet new people. Please get in touch if you would like to chat!
